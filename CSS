/* if I create a class, anytime I use that class the information I'm associating it to will change. However, if I don't add a "class" or "id" to the content than it'll use the asterisk selectors parameters */

/* id gets a "#" selector; class gets "." selector */

/* figure out if the order in which I apply margin, border, and padding should follow a specific standard...Is it important? */

/* the asterisk selector will apply a style(s) to any element on a webpage */

/* Remember the text-decoration-line: none; argument in the general section to remove the line from underneath links..its handy */

 /* get in the habit of including box-sizing in all of the CSS that I write to respect the width and heights of the elements; it also saves the users from having to do tedious math */
